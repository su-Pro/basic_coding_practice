# In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one 
# of these people is secretly the town judge. 
# 
#  If the town judge exists, then: 
# 
#  
#  The town judge trusts nobody. 
#  Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge. 
#  There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2. 
#  
# 
#  You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the 
# person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. 
# 
#  Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be 
# identified, or return -1 otherwise. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
# Output: 2
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
# Output: 3
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
# Output: -1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= n <= 1000 
#  0 <= trust.length <= 10⁴ 
#  trust[i].length == 2 
#  All the pairs of trust are unique. 
#  ai != bi 
#  1 <= ai, bi <= n
